Subject: Problems with XHTML support in CGI.pm 2.72
Date: Sat, 02 Sep 2000 17:35:43 +0200

Dear Mr. Stein

Support for XHTML is a very welcome addition to CGI.pm.

I have come across the following problems when trying to validate a
XHTML file created with CGI.pm 2.72:

1. In the DOCTYPE declaration, 'HTML' should be 'html';
2. In the start_form() method, the value of the 'method' attribute
   should be lowercase (i.e. 'get' instead of 'GET');
3. The hidden() method does not produce a proper empty element
   (the other methods producing 'input' elements seem to behave
correctly);
4. The 'true' values of attributes in form elements (like 'checked',
   'multiple', etc. should be made from the names of the attribute
rather than
   'yes'.

This is just a random list of problems that occurred with a specific
(small)
application. If you think that a more exhaustive test and error report
could
be useful, I will gladly try to set up a more complete test. I am using
nsgmls for validation.

Kind regards,
Nicolas Kessler
